# Conversational Chatbot with SentenceTransformer and GPT-Neo

## Overview

To build a **conversational chatbot** capable of handling dynamic, context-aware interactions, using **SentenceTransformer** and **GPT-Neo** together is a powerful approach. Here's why:

## How Both Work Together

### 1. **SentenceTransformer**

- **Finds Relevant Information**:  
   It converts **user questions** and **FAQ entries** into embeddings (dense vector representations). These embeddings allow the chatbot to compare the **semantic similarity** between the user's input and the existing FAQs.

- **Contextual Matching**:  
   It helps identify the most relevant FAQ answer by measuring **similarity** to past questions stored in the database. This ensures the chatbot retrieves the most relevant information based on what the user has asked.

### 2. **GPT-Neo**

- **Generates Responses**:  
   Once **SentenceTransformer** retrieves relevant FAQ data, **GPT-Neo** takes this data and generates **natural, contextually-aware responses**. GPT-Neo adds conversational depth to the answers.

- **Dynamic Conversations**:  
   GPT-Neo can handle **ongoing conversations** by remembering prior questions and answers. The conversation history (stored in a database) can be passed to GPT-Neo to provide context, making the responses more personalized and fluent.

## Typical Flow

### User Input: User asks a question.

1. **SentenceTransformer**:
   - Converts the user question into an **embedding**.
   - Compares the question to stored FAQ questions in the **SQLite database**.
   - Retrieves the most similar FAQ answers using **embeddings** and **cosine similarity**.

2. **GPT-Neo**:
   - Takes the most relevant FAQ answer and generates a **conversational response** in **natural language**.
   - Optionally, incorporates previous questions and answers in the conversation for **context**, making the response more fluent and relevant.

- **Store Conversations**:  
   The chatbot's previous questions and answers can be stored in a **conversations table** and used by GPT-Neo to maintain **conversation context**.

## Why Use Both?

- **SentenceTransformer** enables **fast and efficient retrieval** of relevant information based on semantic similarity.  
- **GPT-Neo** takes the retrieved information and generates **personalized, fluent responses**, enriching the user interaction and making the conversation more **human-like**.

## In Short:

- **SentenceTransformer** helps find the most relevant answers from the **FAQ database** based on similarity.
- **GPT-Neo** takes those answers and generates **dynamic, human-like responses**, creating a smooth and context-aware conversation flow.
