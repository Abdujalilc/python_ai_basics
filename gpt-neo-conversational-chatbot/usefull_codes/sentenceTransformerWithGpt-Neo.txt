To build a conversational chatbot that can handle dynamic, context-aware interactions, using both SentenceTransformer and GPT-Neo together is a powerful approach. Here's why:

*****************How Both Work Together:****************

1. SentenceTransformer:

	-Finds Relevant Information: It helps by converting user questions and FAQ entries into embeddings (dense vector representations). The embeddings allow you to compare the semantic similarity between user input and your existing FAQs.
	
	-Contextual Matching: For example, it helps you find the most relevant FAQ answer by measuring similarity to past questions stored in the database. This is useful for retrieving relevant answers based on what the user has asked.

2. GPT-Neo:

	-Generates Responses: After you have retrieved relevant FAQ information using SentenceTransformer, GPT-Neo can take this data and generate natural, contextually-aware responses.
	
	-Dynamic Conversations: It can also handle ongoing conversations by remembering prior questions and answers. You can store the conversational history in a database (e.g., conversations table) and feed it to GPT-Neo to provide context for each new user question.

********************Typical Flow:**********************
##User Input: User asks a question.

1. SentenceTransformer:
	-Converts the user question into an embedding.
	
	-Compares the question to stored FAQ questions (in the SQLite database).

	-Retrieves the most similar FAQ answers (using embeddings and cosine similarity).
	
2. GPT-Neo:
	-Takes the most relevant FAQ answer and generates a conversational, natural language response.
	Optionally, it can incorporate previous questions/answers in the conversation for context, making the response more relevant and fluent.
	
	
3. Store Conversations: 
    -The chatbotâ€™s previous questions and answers can be stored in the conversations table, and these can be passed to GPT-Neo to keep the conversation context **consistent**.
	
*********************Why Use Both?:**********************
-SentenceTransformer allows for fast and efficient retrieval of relevant information based on similarity.

-GPT-Neo then takes that information and can generate personalized, fluent responses, enriching the interaction and making it more conversational.

*********************In Short:**********************
-- SentenceTransformer helps find the most relevant answers from your database of FAQs.

-- GPT-Neo helps generate dynamic, human-like responses based on those answers, creating a conversational flow for the user.
