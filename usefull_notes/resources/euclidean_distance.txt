The similarity threshold of 1.2 is relatively lenient in FAISS when using L2 (Euclidean distance):

Smaller values (e.g., 0.5-1.0):

Stricter: Only very close matches are considered.
Harder to find matches.
Larger values (e.g., >1.2):

More lenient: Allows less similar results.
Increases false positives.
At 1.2, it balances flexibility and accuracy, 
but adjust based on your embedding range or model performance.
