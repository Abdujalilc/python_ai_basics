A tensor is a multidimensional array used to represent data in machine learning, mathematics, and physics. 
It's like a generalization of:

Scalar (0D): A single number (e.g., 5).
Vector (1D): A list of numbers (e.g., [1, 2, 3]).
Matrix (2D): A table of numbers (e.g., [[1, 2], [3, 4]]).
Higher dimensions (3D, 4D, etc.): Data cubes or beyond.

import torch
tensor = torch.tensor([[1, 2], [3, 4]])  # 2D Tensor
print(tensor)
